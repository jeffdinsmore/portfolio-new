  <!--<h2>ProofScan Native App by Transparent Path</h2>-->

  <h1>PROJECT SUMMARY</h1>
  <p>Our team designed a native app for Transparent Path called ProofScan that tracks perishable whole foods from origin
    to the retailer. We performed extensive discovery research to determine what consumers would want in the app.
    Currently there is no app for this product.</p>

  <p>Through research and the needs of the company, we found that consumers desired a method to discover the origins of
    their food, how safely the food was transported, and the path the food took before arriving at its destination. We
    came up with a design that scans the QR code on the product, reveals a ProofScore, and shows the origin and path the
    product took.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <h1>PROBLEM & GOAL</h1>

  <H2>Problem</H2>

  <p>What information do consumers want to see about their food? What features do we design in an app for showing the
    path perishable foods take from their origin to their retailer? What do consumers want to have in this app and how
    do we display this information in an easily digestible way?</p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>

  <p>Created discovery research to uncover what information consumers would find valuable. Design a native app that
    displays the travel path in the food chain and provides a score for the transparency that consumers would resonate
    with.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom:5px">Navigating Product Details</h3>

        alt="A GIF showing a quick walkthrough of scanning an item and seeing the path and origin"
        src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/TransparentPath/image1.gif">
      <div class="text-box" style="overflow:scroll;">Scanning the QR code on a food product will populate specific
        information about food transparency. We designed and chose a ProofScore as an “arch” or “fuel gauge” based on
        user testing several other designs. This design was the most credible and visually appealing for our test
        participants.<br><br>

        In order to show easily digestible information, we designed a deeper dive from the ProofScan page for consumers
        to be able to see detailed information on origins, path of the food chain, and smart sensor data.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <H1>THE PROCESS AND HOW WE GOT THERE</h1>

  <p>Since Transparent Path had done some preliminary research, our team started sketching designs at the same time our
    UX Researcher was developing additional discovery research. We integrated the research results into the designs and
    proceeded to prototyping and user testing. We finalized our designs with the user test results.</p>

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>Our team set up initial interviews to determine how people felt about food safety and food transparency.</p>

  <h2>Synthesize</h2>

  <p>From this research, we gathered that participants had a desire for knowing where their product came from and how it
    was transported. Participants wanted a score to be visually appealing, to look credible, and to give them some kind
    of reassurance.</p>

  <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
  <p>The design process started with some known elements. These elements were based on preliminary research findings
    that demonstrated consumers were interested in knowing the origin and path of their food, a score for the
    transparency of the food product, and the technology of how to track the food product. We used this as a starting
    point in our designs by sketching out the Origin, Path (Provenance) and ProofScore pages.</p>

  <h2>Origin Page</h2>
  <div class="container-pink2">
    <div class="picture3"><img src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/TransparentPath/OriginsSketch.png"

        style="width:23%; padding-left:5%">
    </div>
    <div class="text-box3">When discussing early designs of the Origin page with our peers, we found that there were too
      many taps to expand information.</div>
  </div>
  </div>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom:5px">Origin Page Final Design</h3>
  <div class="container-pink">
    <div class="picture"><img src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/TransparentPath/OriginPageFinal.png"
        alt="final design of origin page" style="width:26%">
      <div class="text-box-pink">We adjusted the design to include information that a consumer could easily view without
        having to click to open up.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Path Page</h2>

        style="width:25%; padding: 3% 0% 3% 4%">
      <div class="text-box-green">We executed early testing with our peers on the first version and found that the word
        “Provenance” did not resonate with anyone. Also, the tabs were too cluttered and confusing.
        <br><br>
        Changes were made and we decided to go with a map view that included icons.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom:5px">Path Map View First Version</h3>

      <div class="text-box-green2">User testing revealed that participants desired a map view but wanted more details
        listed. We took into consideration visual and complexity issues with food products that traveled around the
        world.</div>
    </div>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom:5px">Path Map View Final Design</h3>
  <div class="container">

        alt="final design of the path map page" style="width:24%; padding: 3% 0% 3% 4%">
      <div class="text-box">I created a new map that was able to expand or contract, and a consumer could click on the
        icons to find detailed info of the path. The map and the detailed view was used in the final design.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

      <div class="text-box">The detailed view is also part of the final design where a consumer can swipe the map to get
        additional path information.</div>

  </div>

  <h2>ProofScore Page</h2>

  <div class="container-pink2">

        alt="third iteration drawing of the ProofScore page" style="width:26%; padding:3% 0% 3% 5%">
      <div class="text-box3">We designed the ProofScore page to be the first thing a consumer sees after scanning a
        product. The color scheme and detailed information from the first sketch, and the score and interaction design
        from the second sketch were combined to inform our final design.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom:5px">ProofScore Usability Test Page</h3>
  <div class="container-pink">
    <img src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/TransparentPath/ProofScoreUserTest.png"
      alt="Wireframe used in performing a usability test on the ProofScore page"
      style="width:25%; padding: 3% 0% 3% 4%">
    <div class="text-box2">This design of the ProofScore page was used in a user test. The Origin and Provenance section
      acted as a carousel and a consumer could swipe to get more information. The user testing revealed:
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Visibility issues with light colors and small text</li>
        <li>Too much information overwhelmed the use</li>
        <li>Excessive white space around the score minimized important content, making copy challenging to read</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>ProofScore Preference Test</h2>
  <p>This led the research team to conduct a preference test on the visual of the Proof Score. We created multiple
    styles of displaying a score and used these in the preference test.</p>

  <div class="container-pink-score"><img src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/TransparentPath/ScoreTest.png"
      alt="six different iteration drawings of how the score will be displayed on the ProofScore page"
      style="width:78%; padding: 3% 0% 3% 4%">
    <p class="p5" style="margin-left: 4%"><span style="font-family: nimbus">1.</span> A preference test on the visual
      score found that most participants preferred the Fico Style Score.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom:5px">Score Preference A/B Test</h3>
  <img src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/TransparentPath/ScoreTestA.png"
    alt="high fidelity image of circular score shown in an A/B preference test"

    style="width:35%; padding-left:10%">
  <p class="p5"><span style="font-family: nimbus;">A.</span> An additional preference test using high fidelity
    wireframes was performed with most participants preferring the Fico Style Score again.</p>

  <h2>ProofScore Page Final Design</h2>
  <div class="container2">
    <div class="picture"><img src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/TransparentPath/ScorePageFinal.png"
        alt="ProofScore page final design wireframe" style="width:25%">
      <div class="text-box2">In the final design, we redesigned the Origin and Path sections by eliminating the carousel
        and adding a summary of the details. Tapping these tabs will take the consumer into a deeper dive of those
        elements on a separate page. We also updated the ProofScore visual and the text color to be more readable.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h1>ADDITIONAL FEATURES</h1>
  <div class="container">

        get information about food transparency and specific recalls.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Video Walkthrough</h2>
  <p>The first time opening the app to exploring all the pages.</p>

  </div>
  <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

  <p style="clear:right">We completed research and designed an app for the consumer, but there is more to be done.
    Research would be needed on the shipping, distribution and production side to determine what information can be
    collected, and if it would cause additional work for these stakeholders. A design for the supply chain to utilize
    would help complete the app. It was exciting to collaborate on such a compelling and relevant app and I am excited
    to see Transparent Path's journey unfold.</p>
