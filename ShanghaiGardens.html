  <H1>PROJECT SUMMARY</H1>
  <P>I redesigned an existing website for a Chinese restaurant in Seattle. Currently, Shanghai Garden has a long
    scrolling single page website that is difficult to navigate, with hard-to-read menu items.</P>

  <P>Navigation items snap down the page when clicked and it is unclear where a user is on the page after clicking a
    navigation item.</P>

  <P>To give the customer a better shopping experience, the redesign creates easy to navigate pages, updated content,
    and an online checkout delivery option. This was done by adding additional pages to separate content, adding reviews
    from social media, and updating menu categories done by using a card sort. An online ordering page was added for
    to-go orders with an easy checkout process.</p>

  <img class="image-gif" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/FirstGifLaunch.gif">

  <h1>PROBLEM & GOAL</h1>
  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <P>Consumers had a difficult time navigating the website as well as reading menu items. Consumers could not order
    online or order delivery.</P>

  <h2>The Goal</h2>
  <p>Redesign the website so that consumers will be able to navigate the site more easily and read the menu items with
    ease. Add additional features the persona desired for a more fun shopping experience.</p>

  <p>Primary goals for the redesign included:<br>
    more compelling imagery
    a delivery and pickup order option
    organized menu for easily digestible content
    the removal of advertisements</p>

  <p>Secondary goals are to design new pages with more in-depth information on location, about the restaurant, and a
    modern home page with reviews and pictures of popular food items.</p>

  <h1>CONTENT</h1>

  <h2>Current Design</h2>
  <p>Some issues with the current website are:<br>
    The menu has visibility issues
    The menu is really long and there are too many headlines
    The ads are distracting and confusing showing ads for other restaurants
    The nav bar at the top scrolls down to the item instead of going to another page
    It is difficult or impossible to know where you are on the web page as there are no indicators</p>

  <img class="image-shanghai" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/OldNavigation.png">

  <p class="p4">Tiny navigation items that snap down the page when clicked.</p>

  <img class="image-shanghai" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/OldMenuAds.png">

  <p class="p4">It is unclear what is going on here. These must be ads in place over the menu.</p>

  <img class="image-shanghai" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/OldMenu.png">

  <p class="p4">Menu is in picture format and extremely hard to read. Clicking on the menu items takes the customer to
    an enlarged view on another page with more ads.</p>

  <h2>New Design</h2>

  <img class="image-gif" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/SecondGifHome.gif">

  <p class="p3">The home page shows compelling imagery with social media reviews and an easy to read navigation.</p>

  <img class="image-gif" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/ThirdGifMenu.gif">

  <p class="p3">The menu pages have a list of menu items and prices instead of a PDF or JPEG image.</p>

  <img class="image-gif" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/FourthGifOrder.gif">

  <p class="p3">You can order items, add additional quantities and have your meal delivered to you.</p>


  <h1>RESEARCH: HOW I GOT THERE</h1>

  <h2>Competitive Feature Analysis</h2>

  <img class="image1" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/CompetitiveAnalysis.png">

  <H3>Synthesis</H3>
  <p>There were some basic items missing from the Shanghai Garden website such as an about page, reviews of their
    restaurant, online ordering, and compelling pictures on their homepage. These would be added into the final design
    of the website.</p>

  <h2>Personas</h2>
  <p>After interviewing six participants (two consumers of Shanghai Gardens and four restaurant consumers), I came up
    with the following personas: Juan and Janet.</p>

  <img class="image1" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/PersonaAV2.png"
    style="padding:20px 0px 20px 0px;">
  <bR>
  <img class="image1" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/PersonaBV2.png" style="padding:20px 0px;">

  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>Grouping themes and ideas from the personas and competitor websites, I sketched out ideas for the pages of the
    website. I got inspiration on designs from Imjai Thai in Portland, Din Tai Fung, King Noodle, and Green Leaf
    Vietnamese Restaurant.</p>

    <p class="Shanghai-text" style="padding-bottom:4%">Juan and Janet desired easy-to-read menus with predictable menu
      categories.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="Shanghai-text" style="padding-bottom:5%">With her busy schedule and kids, Janet wants to order takeout or
      delivery for enjoyable, timely dinners.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 style="padding-top:4%">Card Sort of Menu Categories</h2>

  <p>Since the menu seemed confusing, I created a card sort using common items. The result was the original menu items
    were condensed from 15 items to nine items. The new menu became more predictable and easy to navigate for the
    consumer.</p>


  <ul class="card-sort">
    <li class="card-sort2">Current Menu</li>
    <li>After Card Sort</li>

  </ul>
  <img class="picture-shanghai" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/MenuCardSort.png">
  <h1>USER TESTING</h1>

  <p>I tested six participants on navigating the website and completing a delivery order for five specific items. I
    asked that they give details on their feelings of using the site, anything that caught their attention, and anything
    that was confusing and could be updated.</p>


  <img class="image-callouts" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/HomePageCallOutV3_3.jpg">

  <p class="Shanghai-text-CallOut">Headlines were added to the home page to signify what a person was looking at and to
    show separation of items on the page. Social media reviews were changed to the original size from the respective
    websites for consistency, predictability, and visibility.</p>

  <img class="image-callouts2" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/MenuCallOutV3_2.jpg">

  <p class="Shanghai-text-CallOut">To prevent a long scrolling menu page with dozens of pictures per category, the menu
    items were changed from pictures to text with pricing for easy to find items.</p>

  <img class="image-callouts3" src="https://jeffdinsmore.com/images/ShanghaiGardens/MyOrderCallOutV3-01.jpg">

  <p class="Shanghai-text-CallOut">Titles were added to the menu items and order box. The tested version gave
    participants the impression that the menu items in the middle were the items that were already on their order.</p>

  <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

  <p>Participants in the user testing were pleased with the new design and had an easy time ordering items. The new
    design hits on key goals and needs of Juan and Janet, such as easy to read menus, take out and delivery ordering,
    social media information, and appealing imagery. It also assists in some pain points for Juan and Janet to be able
    to read the menu and order quickly.</p>

  <p>The navigation is intuitive and illustrates the section the user has chosen on the website, while the footer
    provides helpful information.</p>

  <p style="clear:right">To finalize the product, I would do an additional user test and collaborate with developers and
    other stakeholders before launching the product.</p>
